# About Me

## Hey, I'm Chris.

I'm a Nashville based developer. Mostly focused on mobile, server-side, and system architecture programming and design. Most of my time is split evenly between Android, iOS, Go, Grails, Node.js, Unity3D, and AWS. I've been known dabble in back-end, front-end, games, hardware, desktop, and just about every other type of code as well.

Take a peak at my blog, check out my open source goodies on GitHub, and say hey to me on Twitter @kylewbanks.
